    "content" : "Chokers have always felt like such a '90s staple â€” from Sabrina the Teenage Witch to our impossibly cool grade-school babysitter, almost everyone wore them during the grunge decade. But what the real history of chokers teaches us is that there's more to the black velvet ribbon than we thought. It hasn't only been found in Delia's catalogs and teen's jewelry boxes, and it turns out it has taken more forms than just the plastic tattoo variety. (I know, I'm floored, too.)  Chokers have gone as far back as ancient Egypt, and have adorned the necks of royal Pharaohs and queens of England alike. While some were hammered with gold or strung with diamonds and pearls, others took the form of simple red ribbons bought from the market. They were used by British teens in the 1700s as a way to mock the French, and kept being on-trend all through the Victorian era up to the psychedelic '70s where they showed up on men's necks more often than women's. Chokers have a long and interesting history, full of drama, glamour, gender-bending, and superstitions, making the simple necklace anything but simple. Ahead is the history of chokers; come see how far they've come.",
